 <div class="about-me__body">
     <p>I developed a passion for coding while pursuing my Computer Applications degree in college,
         and since then it became a hobby. After graduating, I started working as a fullstack developer in a
         company.
         I worked alongside senior developers with both frontend and backend technologies.</p>
     <p>Passionate about the work I do, I offer full attention, dedication, personalization and quality to the
         projects I build.
         I believe that learning in the tech industry never really ends, and so, I am always looking for ways to
         expand my current skillset and gain new skills.</p>
